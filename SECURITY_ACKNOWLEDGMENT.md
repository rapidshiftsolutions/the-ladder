# Security Acknowledgment System

## Overview

The Security Acknowledgment System provides an educational security modal that appears before customers access online banking services. This dual-purpose system:

1. **Educates** customers about phishing protection and security best practices
2. **Provides legal protection** (CYA) by documenting user acknowledgment of security guidelines

## Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Education
- Clear warnings about phishing attempts
- Guidance on legitimate bank communication practices
- Contact information for reporting suspicious activity
- Best practices for secure banking

### üéØ Smart Targeting
- Automatically detects banking URLs that require acknowledgment
- Works with existing external link warning system
- Session-based acknowledgment (users see modal once per session)
- Configurable URL patterns for different banking services

### üöÄ User Experience
- Non-blocking modal design
- Clear visual hierarchy with security icons
- Consistent with existing site design patterns
- Mobile-responsive layout

## Implementation

### Architecture

```
SecurityAcknowledgmentWrapper
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SecurityAcknowledgmentProvider (Context)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GlobalBankingLinkHandler (Event Listener)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SecurityAcknowledgmentModal (UI Component)
```

### Integration Points

1. **DOMOptimizer.jsx** - Wraps entire app with security context
2. **Layout Integration** - Works alongside existing external link system
3. **Global Event Handling** - Intercepts clicks on banking links

### Banking URL Monitored

- `secure.servisfirstbank.com` - Online Banking (the only URL that triggers the security acknowledgment)

## Usage

### Testing

Visit `/security-demo` to test the implementation with sample banking links.

### Configuration

Banking URLs are configured in `SecurityAcknowledgmentContext.jsx`:

```javascript
const BANKING_URLS = [
  'secure.servisfirstbank.com'
];
```

### Session Management

- Acknowledgment is stored in `sessionStorage`
- Resets when browser session ends
- Can be manually reset for testing

## Best Practices Implemented

Based on banking security research:

‚úÖ **Non-urgent messaging** - No pressure tactics that could be mimicked by scammers  
‚úÖ **Clear security indicators** - Shield icons and official branding  
‚úÖ **Educational content** - Teaches users to recognize legitimate vs. fraudulent communications  
‚úÖ **Contact information** - Provides official channels for reporting suspicious activity  
‚úÖ **Verification reminders** - Emphasizes checking official website URLs  
‚úÖ **Session-based** - Balances security with user experience
